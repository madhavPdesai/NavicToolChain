A bit demodulator which accepts Qp, code phase and
other tracking loop values and demodulates the
bits encoded in the Qp values and indexes them
with a milli-second epoch count and a code-phase.

A simple FSM is used to demodulate the bits.  On initialization,
the FSM waits for 100 samples, then looks for four sign
transitions separated by multiples of 20ms, and then  starts
generating the bits using the qp-sum values in 20ms bit
intervals.  It also reports quality related numbers.  See
the header and source files for more details.
